           <h1>Git Me Goin' Psycho</h1>
            <div class="psycho">
                <p>You, <b>git</b>… you really get me goin.  I just can’t stop checking out your <b>git --version</b>! You’re way past 2.0, you are incredible. Sometimes I find myself thinking about how you <b>git init</b>, and I have to chuckle to myself and admire you’re can-do attitude. You’re a real Go-Gitter! </p>
	            <p>I’d like to think that I know everything about you, but then I <b>git status</b> and my whole world turns upside down! You’re my little mystery program, git. I know that sometimes you have to tell me that there are things that I have forgotten to <b>git add .</b> to my staging directory, but I hope you know that your color coding makes me feel like I don’t even need to read half of the stuff you say! The red, it screams to me, it tells me that all I need to do is add those stupid files! Before I know it, all those files are green, in the clear, and I can’t help but think of bamboo forests after a fresh afternoon drizzle. </p>
	            <p>I know you have a lot of people tell you that they are ready to <b>git commit -m “right NOW”</b>, but I guess you could say that I’m a little old school. I want to wait. I want to soak up the moments that make you so special. I want to listen to you whirr my little laptop fans, and tell me all about how you stage things.</p>
	            <p>Someday, we can both commit together, but I don’t want to <b>git push –u origin master</b> until we are both tearing at the heavens, and showing the world that we  can manage anything they can throw at us! </p>
	            <p>In fact, I’ve been thinking about it, and if you need to <b>git checkout &lt;an old commit&gt;</b>, that’s totally ok. I know sometimes you feel like your head is falling off, but just remember that I am ready. That’s right, I’m finally ready to make some branches with you! Maybe we can <b>git branch &lt;adoptions&gt;</b>, so that we can help some little branch find its way. I know those branch names are kinda crazy, but we can always <b>git branch -m &lt;adoptions&gt; &lt;whitewash&gt;</b>! The best thing about those branches is you can always <b>git branch -D &lt;unwanted&gt;</b> branches, he he! It can be our little <b>git secret init</b>. We only have to <b>git secret tell eachother@psycho.org</b>! We can <b>git secret add .</b> them to our garden if we want. I’m sure we can <b>git secret hide</b> so many down there, and make our tomatoes grow so big and healthy!! Our own little Angel Branch Garden.</p>
