            At first I was afraid,<br>
            I was petrified,<br>
            Kept thinkin’ I cant ever work this goddamn website,<br>
            but then I spent so many days,<br> 
            learning all your in’s and out’s,<br>
            and I grew strong,<br>
            and I learned how to follow along!<br>

            So now I’m back,<br>
            with lots of steaze,<br>

            to my repositories!<br>

            Who would’ve guessed Version Control,<br>
            Could be anything but dull?<br>
