           <h1>Bash My Heart Out</h1>
           <div class="heart">
               <p>My head is pounding again. I always forget to follow my liquor with water, and lately the liquor is finding me more and more often. The man in the mirror looks more haggard than I remember. More haggard, and less interested. I’m trying to keep everything together, but who am I kidding, my life is a fuckin mess since you left. Why did you leave so much shit behind? Boxes and boxes of useless trash that I’m supposed to care about or something? How much of this is even mine? Who knows, and who cares.   </p> 
                <p>I manage to fight the morning booze-shakes off long enough to pound a few cups of coffee, and follow them with a couple pieces of moldy toast. I sit down in the living room and decide it’s time for me to stop staring at this shit.</p>
                <p>I <b>cd</b> around for a while, moving from box to box, trying to get my bearings in this sea of disappointment and disarray. Occasionally, I <b>ls</b> the contents, but it feels like there is something missing. Then I <b>ls –la</b> and all the hidden shit hits me too fast. The coffee and toast come up with a mouthful of tequila and bile, but your cashmere scarf made a decent hankie. Scarfs are so fuckin’<em> stupid</em>. I open up a fresh industrial strength trash bag, the black kind that you imagine a serial killer using to wrap up severed limbs, and <b>rm</b> the vomit-soaked scarf. “See you later, alligator.” I mumble to myself through a thick coat of cottonmouth.</p>
                <p>Before I know it, the bag is bulging from all of your lighthouse paintings, and stupid rocks you insisted we pick up on our hikes. I check the <b>times</b>, and I’ve been at it for over 4 hours. Slowly packing all of your shit up and <b>mv</b>’ing it to the dumpster. I’ve thrown up twice more beside the dumpster, and the neighborhood cat wont stop hissing at me. I pull out my <b>crontab</b> and schedule a call to the local animal control to come and cage this freakin’ monster.</p>
                <p>I feel like death, but I can’t stop now, so I decide to <b>mkdir</b>  some boxes for all my stuff. <b>mkdir shittyDvds clothesthtdntfit nudeymags</b>… you know, the essentials. I suck at staying organized, so I <b>touch inventory.txt</b> and write down a brief list of sickly bullshit I’ve collected along the way. </p>
                <ul class="badlist">
                    <li>The Matrix Collection (Missing 2nd movie)</li>
                    <li>Mom’s ashes (Note to self: <b>crontab</b> a time to dump these.)</li>
                    <li>Photobooth pictures of you and I at your friend’s wedding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I throw up again. This isn’t working. I <b>cd ..</b> back to the kitchen and out the frost window over the sink, I <b>diff myLifeThen.txt myLifeNow.txt</b>. My <b>pwd</b> isn’t so bad. I have plenty of space to stretch out without you in the bed. No more clogged showers, no more guilt trips about drinking on Friday nights, no more pretending to care about all of your boring friends.</p>
	            <p>Time for me to <b>top</b>, and <b>kill guilt.exe</b>.</p>
